  <h2>Computer Security: Review of class</h2>
  
  I found this class to be really interesting. This class taught me many things such as Java and Python. I also learned how to create my own website that could be viewed by anyone. This class also exposed me to many bright people that were all very nice and helpful to me. They were all willing to help me whenever I needed help. I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in computers or would like to maybe eventually have a job that is regarding computers.
